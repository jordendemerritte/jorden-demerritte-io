- Pull request https://github.com/jordendemerritte/jorden-demerritte-io/pull/6

1. **When was a time you got misinformation or bad advice? What happened? Also consider any time an artificial intelligence tool has given you bad/weird answers. Share about that experience here.** Well I can't recall anything at the momentâ€“generally I don't trust the internet and largely take it with a grain of salt. There used to be this show on the History Channel about Aliens and Ghost Hunters that spewed misrepresentations of reality, which I can point as as misinformation
2. **What are some â€˜cluesâ€™ that you use to help you assess whether a resource is applicable/trustworthy or not? What are some ways you can verify the information you got from AI was accurate/current?** Generally government websites. Large spans of references. Author has a higher degree within the subject or field.
3. **What are some ways youâ€™ll build on your information literacy either in your personal life or as a developer?** Being congizant that there is no truth on the internet, as it can be quickly fabricated or portrayed falsely based on lack of holistic research. This can be akin to history books portraying Columbus as the first to discover the Americas when this is wholly false.

# Lesson 12
- Pull request https://github.com/jordendemerritte/jorden-demerritte-io/pull/5

1. **What was something new you learned about colors/color theory and how do you think that knowledge will effect your design choices?** Tailwind CSS is particularly good at managing colorsâ€“colors pull certain emotions from people. I know for me, whose favorite colors are blue and green, they bring me peace and remind me of the Miami landscape. Additionally, colors can reinforce certin attitudes towards a brand. For example orange gives off an active energy, hence its effectiveness in OrangeTheory and blue gives off approachable/professional vibes hence its effectiveness across workforce webpages.
2. **Try out some different background/foreground color combinations using this tool from A11y. Are there any combinations that surprise you in terms of not meeting accessibility guidelines?** Not necessarily. I'm aware that certain fonts and colors do not allow for a wide audience to read properly. Especially since I am an architecture major, I understand that when building you keep in mind that the audience comes from a wide set of backgrounds and capabilities.

# Lesson 11
- Pull request https://github.com/jordendemerritte/jorden-demerritte-io/pull/4

1. **Think about a time when a layout personally impacted your experience (like the examples in the first paragraph) and describe the scene for us. Also share how you felt when you could/couldn't find what you were looking for.** Greta Thunberg's webpage is amazing and I loved seing how it was organized and the three-dimensional component.
2. **In the visual hierarchy article, were there topics that surprised you? If so, which one(s) and why?** Yes, I was surprised by the implications of visual hierarchy in website design and user research. I will ensure to refer back to this video when developing web applications and products.
3. **What are some of your most favorite and least favorite design features as a user?** Favorite: typography (this makes a large difference in the character of websites and portraying emotions) Least favorite: hero images (most often these seem tacky and out-dated)


# Lesson 10
- Pull request https://github.com/jordendemerritte/jorden-demerritte-io/pull/3

1. **Think of an example of something you have done in your life that you failed at multiple times before you got itâ€”doesn't have to be coding-related, maybe a sports play, a piece on a musical instrument, or a video game level. How did you keep yourself motivated to keep trying?** Getting straight a's in my class took reading cal newport's book to realize and uncover the system behind good grades. Though I managed to pass with final grades of A's and B's in high school, I noticed that my perfomace did not keep up with increasing difficulty in curriculm. Reading this book gave me clear insight on how to improve.
2. **Have you witnessed others learn from failures and then succeed? What strategies have they used?** Yes, my own failures have made me reflect, review, strategize, overcome, and succeed.


# Lesson 9
- Pull request https://github.com/jordendemerritte/jorden-demerritte-io/pull/2
- A11y checklist

 1. **When you've had limited or no access to something, what did you do?  Were you ultimately able to get what you needed?  If not, how did your lack of access impact your life?** I worked around it, when I think of a professor whose learning style does not match with my ownâ€“I found my way around it through by looking up videos, tutorials, asking classmates, and getting personalized tutoring.
2. **Now that you've read about accessibility, and hopefully considered some of the challenges others face using the internet, are there things you can/will do differently in your current/future project(s)?  Give examples/specifics.** When I was on the webaim website I experienced a gap in accessibility, the UX/UI is not tailored to a younger crowd and lacks an immersive quality which many websites have today (ex. Apple store, etc.) Too many quick links and the words are spaced too closely and there's too many words in general.

# Lesson 8 - Imposter Syndrome
- Self doubt about success, 58% of tech workers feel this way (for good reason, they were not prepared properly)
1. **Have you every felt Imposter Syndrome yourself and, if youâ€™re comfortable sharing, how did it manifest itself? What, if anything, has helped you mitigate these feelings?** Yes, indeed. Daily, all the time. It's an important feeling that makes a person feel as if they aren't enough. I think this feeling has truth in it, but it needs to be channeled through supportive networks and determination to strive and do better.
2. **What do you think are some of the immediate or long-term effects of Imposter Syndrome if left unchecked?** Immediate and long-term effects include decline in self efficacy and trust and increased distrust of others.

# Lesson 7
1. **When asked to think about debugging, what are the first 3 adjectives that jump to mind?** Tedious, high-level, patience.
2. **Are there any debugging practices that youâ€™ve already tried and found helpful?** I learned a tip from a data scientist in Code the Dream to take the "meat" of the code from the function and write it outside to test if that piece works.
3. **Any you havenâ€™t tried yet, but want to practice in this upcoming week?** None comes to mind as of right now ðŸª»
