# Lesson 8 - Imposter Syndrome
- Self doubt about success, 58% of tech workers feel this way (for good reason, they were not prepared properly)
1. **Have you every felt Imposter Syndrome yourself and, if youâ€™re comfortable sharing, how did it manifest itself? What, if anything, has helped you mitigate these feelings?** Yes, indeed. Daily, all the time. It's an important feeling that makes a person feel as if they aren't enough. I think this feeling has truth in it, but it needs to be channeled through supportive networks and determination to strive and do better.
2. **What do you think are some of the immediate or long-term effects of Imposter Syndrome if left unchecked?** Immediate and long-term effects include decline in self efficacy and trust and increased distrust of others.

# Lesson 7
1. **When asked to think about debugging, what are the first 3 adjectives that jump to mind?** Tedious, high-level, patience.
2. **Are there any debugging practices that youâ€™ve already tried and found helpful?** I learned a tip from a data scientist in Code the Dream to take the "meat" of the code from the function and write it outside to test if that piece works.
3. **Any you havenâ€™t tried yet, but want to practice in this upcoming week?** None comes to mind as of right now ðŸª»
