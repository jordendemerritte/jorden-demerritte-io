# Lesson 7
1. **When asked to think about debugging, what are the first 3 adjectives that jump to mind?** Tedious, high-level, patience
2. **Are there any debugging practices that youâ€™ve already tried and found helpful?** I learned a tip from a data scientist in Code the Dream to take the "meat" of the code from the function and write it outside to test if that piece works
3. **Any you havenâ€™t tried yet, but want to practice in this upcoming week?** None comes to mind as of right now ðŸª»
