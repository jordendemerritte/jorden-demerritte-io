# Lesson 9
- A11y checklist

 1. **When you've had limited or no access to something, what did you do?  Were you ultimately able to get what you needed?  If not, how did your lack of access impact your life?** I worked around it, when I think of a professor whose learning style does not match with my ownâ€“I found my way around it through by looking up videos, tutorials, asking classmates, and getting personalized tutoring.
2. **Now that you've read about accessibility, and hopefully considered some of the challenges others face using the internet, are there things you can/will do differently in your current/future project(s)?  Give examples/specifics.** When I was on the webaim website I experienced a gap in accessibility, the UX/UI is not tailored to a younger crowd and lacks an immersive quality which many websites have today (ex. Apple store, etc.) Too many quick links and the words are spaced too closely and there's too many words in general.

# Lesson 8 - Imposter Syndrome
- Self doubt about success, 58% of tech workers feel this way (for good reason, they were not prepared properly)
1. **Have you every felt Imposter Syndrome yourself and, if youâ€™re comfortable sharing, how did it manifest itself? What, if anything, has helped you mitigate these feelings?** Yes, indeed. Daily, all the time. It's an important feeling that makes a person feel as if they aren't enough. I think this feeling has truth in it, but it needs to be channeled through supportive networks and determination to strive and do better.
2. **What do you think are some of the immediate or long-term effects of Imposter Syndrome if left unchecked?** Immediate and long-term effects include decline in self efficacy and trust and increased distrust of others.

# Lesson 7
1. **When asked to think about debugging, what are the first 3 adjectives that jump to mind?** Tedious, high-level, patience.
2. **Are there any debugging practices that youâ€™ve already tried and found helpful?** I learned a tip from a data scientist in Code the Dream to take the "meat" of the code from the function and write it outside to test if that piece works.
3. **Any you havenâ€™t tried yet, but want to practice in this upcoming week?** None comes to mind as of right now ðŸª»
